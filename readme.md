I know I want to use my renoise sync lib somehow.
I also know I want to use Haxe and Luxe vs WebGL.
As a masochistic experiment, let’s do all our dev on a mac using Atom.

Maybe this is my social anxiety / agoraphobia game? The feeling of being in a crowd for an introvert sure sounds weaponizeable to me.

How am I going to communicate the siege mentality of agoraphobia in a way that will /play well/ is the question.. I’m not sure it’s worth doing if the game is crap just to make a point.

Then again I’ve a day and a half… Being crap or not may not be an option..
