# LD32 - “Unconventional Weapon”

I know I want to use my renoise sync lib somehow.
I also know I want to use Haxe and Luxe vs WebGL.
As a masochistic experiment, let’s do all our dev on a mac using Atom.

Maybe this is my social anxiety / agoraphobia game? The feeling of being in a crowd for an introvert sure feels weaponizeable to me.

How am I going to communicate the siege mentality of agoraphobia in a way that will /play well/ is the question… I’m not sure it’s worth doing if the game is crap just to make a point.

Then again I’ve a day and a half… Being crap or not may not be an option..

# LD32 - “Hiding in plain sight”

Whenever I try to communicate my brand of social anxiety to people (I do realise experiences differ enough to make labelling one person’s trauma in the language of another’s is insultingly futile) the basic feeling is full-on fight-or-flight, with an emphasis on flight, because my “conscious” mind knows the situation isn’t dangerous. It’s like having a second person jump the controls: I’ve found myself walking down a street, spot a crowd coming in the opposite direction, and practically *feel* myself being turned as close as I can be to the opposite direction. It’s a humiliating feeling, because again, you *know* it’s ridiculous yet you just can’t help yourself. The compulsion to *leave* is strong enough that the amount of willpower needed to talk yourself out of the decision is insurmountable. If there’s no escape, I go cold. It’s like throwing up a shield against each and every person around you whose names you do not know. There was a time I couldn’t be inside of a McDonald’s without entering that state, and I’d ask my friends to order my food for me because I was literally not capable of doing it. Again, I realise how absurd this must sound to someone who hasn’t experienced it. 

Most people feel some variation of this trepidation but I can’t stress enough how *extreme* it feels. It feels like if you make a single mistake that mistake will sit with you for life (if you do make such a mistake, it tends to sit with you for months. Not the same but shitty nonetheless).

This feeling of repulsion from groups, or where being singular against the many, might be exploitable as a game mechanic. Clustering entities can represent larger “blobs” of repulsive force, and flocking behaviours can organically create and ambulate these clusters. I need some way to stress the singularity of the player versus the plurality of The Others.
